Create an infographic for the context below.
Creative process:
- First, deeply understand the content. What is the core insight or relationship?
- Then ask: what is the *shape* of this idea?
  - Is it a tension between two things? → two ends of a line, a tug-of-war
  - Is it a progression? → a curve, a path, an arrow
  - Is it a cycle? → a spiral, a loop
  - Is it a tradeoff? → two axes, a quadrant
  - Is it a transformation? → before/after, diverging paths
  - Is it layers? → concentric circles, a stack
- Find the ONE visual that captures the idea's structure. Then strip away everything else.
Visual approach:
- One simple conceptual sketch — a graph, curve, spiral, quadrant, axes, Venn, or simple shapes
- Truly hand-drawn: wobbly lines, imperfect circles, raw and unpolished
- Handwritten labels — messy, quick, like actual pen on paper
- Black or dark ink only
- Background: white with subtle paper or napkin texture — tactile, organic
- NO icons, NO illustrations, NO people, NO detailed drawings
- Just: lines, shapes, arrows, and handwritten words
- The kind of sketch you'd make in 30 seconds to land an idea
The best result looks like a brilliant napkin sketch — the moment an idea became clear, captured in pen.

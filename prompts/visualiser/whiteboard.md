Create an infographic for the context below.
Creative process:
- First, identify the core concept or process being explained. How would a teacher or professor sketch this out to help someone understand? What are the key elements, relationships, and flow?
Visual approach:
- Whiteboard/dry-erase aesthetic: hand-drawn feel, sketchy lines, marker texture
- Background: white or off-white, like an actual whiteboard or paper
- Hand-drawn diagrams, arrows, boxes, circles, and connectors
- Mix of simple illustrations and text labels
- Casual, spontaneous energy — like someone explaining in real-time
- Can include small doodles, underlines, emphasis marks, asterisks
- Color palette: marker colors — black as primary, with red, blue, green, orange as accents
- Text should look handwritten or marker-style, not typeset
- Arrows and flow lines connect ideas
- Imperfect and human — not polished, but clear
The best result feels like walking up to a whiteboard after a great explanation — you can trace the thinking, see the connections, understand the concept at a glance.
